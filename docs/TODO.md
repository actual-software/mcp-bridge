## üìã Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove one TODO comment in `/pkg/common/errors/codes.go:33` (just a comment marker)
- [ ] Review and refactor long functions (>100 lines)
- [ ] Improve error message consistency across services
- [ ] Add more code comments for complex algorithms
- [ ] **Reduce Backend Factory Boilerplate** - Eliminate duplicate wrapper code
  - Consider using Go generics for backend wrappers (all do identical metric copying)
  - Consolidate repetitive parsing methods across backends
  - Reduce factory.go from 459 lines for 3 backends

### Configuration
- [ ] **Migrate to Type-Safe Configuration Structs** - Replace `map[string]interface{}`
  - Move from runtime type assertions to compile-time type safety
  - Benefits: IDE autocomplete, validation at unmarshal, self-documenting, fewer runtime errors
  - Create typed config structs for each backend (StdioConfig, WebSocketConfig, SSEConfig, GRPCConfig)
  - Use struct tags for validation (`validate:"required"`, `validate:"min=1s"`)
  - Consider breaking change for v2.0.0 or provide migration tooling
- [ ] Consolidate configuration validation across services
- [ ] Add configuration schema versioning
- [ ] Implement configuration hot-reload
- [ ] Add configuration migration tooling

### Documentation
- [ ] Add more architecture diagrams
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Add interactive API documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting decision trees
