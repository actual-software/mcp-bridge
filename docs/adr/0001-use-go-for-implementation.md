# ADR-0001: Use Go for Implementation

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-08-01

**Authors**: @poiley

## Context

We need to choose a programming language for implementing the MCP Bridge system. The language choice will impact performance, maintainability, deployment, and developer productivity.

### Requirements

- High performance for handling concurrent connections
- Low memory footprint for cost-effective scaling
- Strong networking and concurrency primitives
- Cross-platform compilation support
- Good ecosystem for cloud-native development
- Easy deployment with single binary distribution

### Constraints

- Team has varying levels of experience with different languages
- Need to integrate with existing Go-based infrastructure
- Must support WebSocket, HTTP/2, and potentially gRPC
- Requires robust error handling for production reliability

## Decision

We will use Go (Golang) as the primary implementation language for both the Gateway and Router components of MCP Bridge.

### Implementation Details

- Use Go 1.21+ for latest language features and performance improvements
- Leverage Go modules for dependency management
- Use standard library where possible to minimize dependencies
- Implement with goroutines for concurrent request handling

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Excellent concurrency model with goroutines and channels
- **Deployment**: Single static binary simplifies deployment and reduces dependencies
- **Memory efficiency**: Low memory overhead compared to JVM or interpreted languages
- **Cloud-native**: Strong ecosystem for Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud services
- **Network programming**: Excellent standard library support for HTTP, WebSocket, TLS
- **Cross-compilation**: Easy to build for multiple platforms from single codebase
- **Tooling**: Great built-in tooling (testing, profiling, formatting)

### Negative

- **Generics**: Limited generic programming (though improved in Go 1.18+)
- **Error handling**: Verbose error handling compared to exceptions
- **Learning curve**: Team members unfamiliar with Go need training
- **Dependency management**: Less mature than npm or Maven ecosystems

### Neutral

- Opinionated language design enforces consistency
- Garbage collection may introduce latency (though generally minimal)
- Static typing requires more upfront design but catches errors early

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Rust

**Description**: Systems programming language with memory safety and no garbage collection

**Pros**:
- Zero-cost abstractions and maximum performance
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Strong type system prevents many bugs

**Cons**:
- Steep learning curve with borrow checker
- Longer development time
- Smaller talent pool
- More complex async programming model

**Reason for rejection**: While Rust offers superior performance, the complexity and longer development time don't justify the benefits for this use case.

### Alternative 2: Node.js/TypeScript

**Description**: JavaScript runtime with TypeScript for type safety

**Pros**:
- Large ecosystem and talent pool
- Familiar to many developers
- Good for rapid prototyping
- Native JSON handling

**Cons**:
- Single-threaded event loop limitations
- Higher memory usage
- Deployment requires Node runtime
- Performance limitations for CPU-intensive tasks

**Reason for rejection**: Performance limitations and deployment complexity make it less suitable for a high-performance gateway.

### Alternative 3: Java/Kotlin

**Description**: JVM-based languages with enterprise adoption

**Pros**:
- Mature ecosystem
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Strong typing with Kotlin
- Good performance with JIT compilation

**Cons**:
- JVM overhead and memory usage
- Longer startup times
- More complex deployment
- Verbose (Java) or smaller community (Kotlin)

**Reason for rejection**: JVM overhead and deployment complexity outweigh benefits for our use case.

## Notes

This decision should be revisited if:
- Performance requirements significantly change
- Team composition shifts dramatically
- Go ecosystem limitations become blocking issues
- New language features in alternatives address current concerns
