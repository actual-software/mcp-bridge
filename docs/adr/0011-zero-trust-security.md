# ADR-0011: Zero-Trust Security Model

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-08-11

**Authors**: @poiley

## Context

Traditional perimeter-based security models assume trust within the network boundary. However, modern distributed systems require a more robust security approach that assumes no implicit trust, especially for a system like MCP Bridge that handles sensitive model interactions.

### Requirements

- Never trust, always verify - every request must be authenticated and authorized
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Principle of least privilege for all components
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Audit logging for all security events
- Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

### Constraints

- Must maintain low latency despite security checks
- Cannot break existing client compatibility
- Must work in various deployment environments
- Need to balance security with usability

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive zero-trust security architecture with multiple layers of defense:

1. **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** between all components
2. **Per-request authentication** and authorization
3. **End-to-end encryption** with forward secrecy
4. **Principle of least privilege** with RBAC
5. **Security scanning** and vulnerability management
6. **Audit logging** and monitoring
7. **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection

### Implementation Details

```yaml
security:
  # mTLS Configuration
  tls:
    enabled: true
    min_version: "1.3"
    cipher_suites:
      - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
      - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    client_auth: required
    
  # Authentication
  auth:
    require_auth: true
    methods: [bearer, oauth2, mtls]
    token_validation:
      verify_exp: true
      verify_aud: true
      verify_iss: true
    
  # Authorization  
  rbac:
    enabled: true
    default_policy: deny
    policies:
      - role: admin
        permissions: ["*"]
      - role: user
        permissions: ["read", "write"]
      - role: readonly
        permissions: ["read"]
    
  # Security Headers
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
    
  # Rate Limiting
  rate_limiting:
    enabled: true
    global: 10000/min
    per_ip: 100/min
    per_user: 1000/min
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Strong security posture**: Multiple layers of defense
- **Compliance ready**: Meets most regulatory requirements
- **Audit trail**: Complete visibility into all actions
- **Reduced attack surface**: Minimal trust boundaries
- **Incident response**: Quick detection and mitigation
- **Future proof**: Adaptable to new threats

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More components to configure and manage
- **Performance overhead**: Security checks add latency
- **Certificate management**: mTLS requires PKI infrastructure
- **Debugging difficulty**: Encryption makes troubleshooting harder
- **User friction**: Stricter authentication requirements

### Neutral

- Requires security training for development team
- Need dedicated security monitoring
- Regular security audits required

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Perimeter Security Only

**Description**: Traditional firewall and VPN based security

**Pros**:
- Simpler to implement
- Less performance overhead
- Familiar model
- Easier debugging

**Cons**:
- Vulnerable to insider threats
- No protection once perimeter breached
- Doesn't scale with cloud deployments
- Limited visibility

**Reason for rejection**: Insufficient for modern threat landscape and distributed deployments.

### Alternative 2: Service Mesh Security

**Description**: Delegate all security to Istio/Linkerd

**Pros**:
- Centralized policy management
- Automatic mTLS
- Built-in observability
- No application changes

**Cons**:
- Requires service mesh deployment
- Limited to network layer security
- Less application-aware
- Vendor lock-in

**Reason for rejection**: Not all deployments will use service mesh, need application-level security.

### Alternative 3: API Gateway Pattern

**Description**: Single API gateway handles all security

**Pros**:
- Centralized security enforcement
- Single point of configuration
- Good for rate limiting
- Simplified architecture

**Cons**:
- Single point of failure
- Bottleneck at scale
- No end-to-end encryption
- Trust after gateway

**Reason for rejection**: Violates zero-trust principles with implicit trust after gateway.
