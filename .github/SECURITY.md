## Reporting Security Issues

Please report security concerns privately rather than through public issues.

### Contact Methods

**Primary**: Email to security@example.com (update with actual contact)

**Alternative**: Use GitHub's private reporting feature:
1. Navigate to the Security tab
2. Select "Report a concern"
3. Provide detailed information

### Information to Include
- Description of the concern
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected components or files
- Potential impact assessment
- Any supporting evidence

## Response Process

### Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Regular Updates**: Weekly progress reports
- **Resolution**: Based on severity level

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Fixed within 7 days
- **High**: Fixed within 30 days
- **Medium**: Fixed within 90 days
- **Low**: Addressed in next release

## Security Architecture

### Network Protection
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
- Certificate validation with proper verification
- Protocol version enforcement

### Access Control
- JWT-based authentication with signature validation
- OAuth2 integration with token verification
- Certificate-based client authentication
- Permission-based access control

### Input Protection
- Request size limitations
- Input sanitization and validation
- UTF-8 enforcement for text data
- JSON schema validation

### Service Protection  
- Connection rate limiting per client
- Request throttling with Redis storage
- Circuit breaker patterns for dependencies
- Resource usage monitoring

### Operational Safeguards
- Security-focused default configurations
- Audit logging for important events
- Comprehensive security headers
- No sensitive data in logs or errors

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Production Settings

```yaml
# Gateway Service
server:
  tls:
    min_version: "1.3"
    preferred_ciphers: 
      - "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
      - "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"
  
  limits:
    requests_per_minute: 1000
    concurrent_connections: 100
    max_request_size: "10MB"
  
  features:
    cors_enabled: false
    security_headers: true
    audit_logging: true

# Router Service
client:
  tls:
    verify_certificates: true
    min_version: "1.3"
  
  auth:
    credential_store: "system_keychain"
    auto_refresh_tokens: true
    token_validation: true
```

### Security Headers

Automatically applied headers include:
- Strict Transport Security with long duration
- Content Security Policy with restrictive defaults
- Frame Options set to deny
- Content Type Options set to no-sniff
- Referrer Policy with strict origin
- Permissions Policy with minimal grants

## Update Process

### Development
1. Security concern assessment and validation
2. Fix development with comprehensive testing
3. Security advisory preparation
4. Coordinated timing for public disclosure
5. Release with clear security notes

### Notification
- GitHub Security Advisories for all updates
- Release notes highlighting security improvements
- Documentation updates for configuration changes

## Deployment Best Practices

### Infrastructure
- Always enable TLS encryption in production
- Keep software updated to latest versions
- Implement network segmentation and firewall rules
- Use principle of least privilege for access
- Monitor systems for unusual activity patterns

### Development
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Scan dependencies regularly for known issues
- Use static analysis tools during development
- Include security testing in validation processes
- Review code changes with security considerations

## Disclosure Timeline

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Initial Contact** (Day 0): Issue reported privately
2. **Assessment** (Days 1-3): Evaluation and confirmation
3. **Development** (Days 7-30): Fix creation and testing
4. **Coordination** (Days 30-90): Timing coordination with reporters
5. **Public Release**: After fixes are available and tested

## Contact Information

For urgent security matters:
- **Email**: security@example.com (replace with actual contact)
- **Response**: Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Encryption**: PGP key available upon request

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers who help improve MCP Bridge through responsible disclosure.
