    <!-- CVE-2024-52308: False Positive - Wrong Package Match -->
    <suppress>
        <notes><![CDATA[
        CVE-2024-52308 is a vulnerability in GitHub's official CLI (cli/cli), not mitchellh/cli.
        OWASP Dependency Check is incorrectly matching the package name.

        The actual CVE affects github.com/cli/cli (GitHub's official CLI tool) with a remote
        code execution vulnerability when connecting to malicious SSH servers in Codespaces.

        Our codebase uses github.com/mitchellh/cli, which is an unrelated CLI framework library
        by Mitchell Hashimoto. This is pulled in as a transitive dependency through:
        hashicorp/consul/api -> hashicorp/serf -> mitchellh/cli

        Reference: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87

        <notes><![CDATA[
        CVE-2013-10005 is a vulnerability in the JavaScript json-pointer package, not Go's
        github.com/armon/go-socks5. OWASP is incorrectly matching based on package naming.

        This is a transitive dependency through hashicorp/consul/api.
