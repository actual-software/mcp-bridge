```

### Core Design Principles

1. **Transparent Proxy**: Maintains stdio compatibility while adding remote connectivity
2. **Client-Side Resilience**: Connection pooling, retry logic, and circuit breakers
3. **Security-First**: Secure token storage, per-message auth, and TLS enforcement
4. **Multi-Protocol**: Protocol abstraction with WebSocket and TCP binary support
5. **Zero Configuration**: Sensible defaults with guided setup and auto-discovery
6. **Platform Native**: Cross-platform with OS-specific secure storage (keychain/credential manager)
7. **High Performance**: Connection pooling, request queuing, and efficient binary protocols
8. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, metrics collection, and debugging tools

### Component Architecture

#### 1. Message Flow Pipeline
```go
// Bidirectional message flow
Claude CLI (stdin)
    ↓
[Stdio Handler] → Parse JSON-RPC messages
    ↓
[Request Validator] → Validate message format
    ↓
[Rate Limiter] → Apply client-side limits
    ↓
[Connection Pool] → Acquire/reuse connection
    ↓
[Auth Injector] → Add per-message auth
    ↓
[Protocol Handler] → WebSocket/TCP transport
    ↓
MCP Gateway
    ↓
[Response Correlator] → Match request/response
    ↓
[Response Handler] → Process response/errors
    ↓
Claude CLI (stdout)
```

#### 2. Connection Management (`internal/pool`)
- **Pool-based architecture** with configurable min/max connections
- **Multi-protocol support** - WebSocket and TCP pools
- **Health checking** of idle connections with automatic cleanup
- **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Connection lifecycle management** with proper cleanup and statistics
- **Generic connection interface** for protocol abstraction
- **Pool statistics** for monitoring and debugging

#### 3. State Correlation
```go
// Request/Response correlation for multiplexed connections
type PendingRequests struct {
    sync.Map // map[string]chan *mcp.Response
    timeout  time.Duration
    cleanup  *time.Ticker
}
```

#### 4. Authentication Architecture (`internal/secure`)
- **Multi-method support**: Bearer tokens, OAuth2, mTLS
- **Secure storage integration**: Platform-native keychains and credential managers
- **Cross-platform storage**: macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service
- **Encrypted file fallback**: Machine-specific encryption for unsupported platforms
- **Token lifecycle management**: Automatic refresh and rotation
- **Per-message authentication**: Enhanced security model with request correlation

#### 5. Request Management (`internal/router`)
- **Request queue management**: Buffering and flow control
- **Message correlation**: Request/response matching with timeouts
- **Connection manager integration**: Automatic connection selection and pooling
- **Metrics collection**: Performance tracking and debugging support

## Core Expertise Areas

### Router Architecture
The Router acts as a transparent proxy:
- **Stdio Interface**: Presents stdio to Claude CLI (maintains compatibility)
- **Multi-Protocol**: Connects via WebSocket (ws/wss) or TCP (tcp/tcps) with binary protocol
- **Advanced Connection Pooling**: Sophisticated pool management with health checking (`internal/pool`)
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Authentication**: Bearer token, mTLS, OAuth2 with secure cross-platform storage
- **Request Correlation**: Multiplexed connections with request/response tracking
- **Performance**: Built-in rate limiting, circuit breaker patterns, and request queuing
- **Binary Protocol Support**: Efficient TCP binary framing for high-performance scenarios

### Multi-Protocol Support

#### WebSocket Protocol
- **URL schemes**: `ws://` (plain), `wss://` (TLS)
- **Use case**: Standard MCP deployments, browser-compatible
- **Implementation**: `internal/gateway/client.go`

#### TCP/Binary Protocol  
- **URL schemes**: `tcp://` (plain), `tcps://` or `tcp+tls://` (TLS)
- **Use case**: High-performance deployments, reduced overhead
- **Implementation**: `internal/gateway/tcp_client.go` with binary framing
- **Performance**: Lower latency and bandwidth usage compared to WebSocket
- **Connection pooling**: Dedicated TCP pool with efficient reuse
- **Binary framing**: Custom protocol with length-prefixed messages

### Authentication Methods

#### Bearer Token (Recommended)
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    type: bearer
    token_secure_key: my-api-token  # Platform keychain storage
    # OR token_env: MCP_AUTH_TOKEN  # Environment variable
    # OR token_file: ~/.mcp/token   # File-based
```

**Secure Storage Platforms**:
- **macOS**: Keychain Access
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **Linux**: Secret Service (requires `secret-tool`)
- **Fallback**: Encrypted file with machine-specific encryption

**Token Management**:
```bash
# Configure tokens via setup wizard
mcp-router setup

# Or configure manually in config file
# See configuration examples below for token_env, token_file, or secure storage options
```

#### mTLS Authentication
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    type: mtls
    client_cert: ~/.mcp/client.crt
    client_key: ~/.mcp/client.key
  tls:
    ca_cert_path: ~/.mcp/ca.crt
```

#### OAuth2 Authentication
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    type: oauth2
    client_id: "your-client-id"
    client_secret_secure_key: oauth-client-secret
    token_endpoint: "https://auth.example.com/token"
    grant_type: "client_credentials"
    scopes: ["mcp:read", "mcp:write"]
```

### Advanced Connection Pooling (`internal/pool`)
```yaml
gateway:
  connection:
    pool:
      enabled: true               # Enable connection pooling
      min_size: 2                # Minimum connections to maintain
      max_size: 10               # Maximum concurrent connections
      max_idle_time_ms: 300000   # 5 minutes idle timeout
      max_lifetime_ms: 1800000   # 30 minutes max lifetime
      acquire_timeout_ms: 5000   # Timeout waiting for connection
      health_check_interval_ms: 30000  # Health check frequency
      statistics_enabled: true   # Enable pool statistics collection
```

**Advanced Features**:
- **Protocol-specific pools**: Separate WebSocket and TCP connection pools
- **Generic connection interface**: Unified connection management across protocols
- **Pool statistics**: Real-time metrics on pool utilization and performance
- **Health checking**: Active connection validation with automatic cleanup
- **Connection lifecycle**: Proper connection creation, validation, and cleanup
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to direct connections when pool is unavailable

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates connection establishment overhead
- Reuses connections across multiple requests
- Automatic recovery from connection failures
- Handles burst traffic with connection queueing
- Protocol abstraction for unified management
- Detailed monitoring and debugging capabilities

### Reconnection Strategy
```yaml
gateway:
  connection:
    reconnect:
      initial_delay_ms: 1000    # Starting delay
      max_delay_ms: 60000       # Maximum delay cap
      multiplier: 2.0           # Exponential backoff multiplier
      max_attempts: 10          # Max retry attempts (-1 = unlimited)
      jitter: 0.1               # Jitter factor to prevent thundering herd
```
